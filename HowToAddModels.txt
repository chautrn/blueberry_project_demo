1) upload your new weight file into .\back_end\src\models\
	**make sure its a .pt file

2) linking weight to front end and updating the dropdown...
  a) open Home.js (.\front_end\src\pages)
  b) go to line ~200
  c) add a new MenuItem under the current MenuItems... follow this structure

	<MenuItem value={"NAMEOFYOURWEIGHTFILE"} 
		onClick={() => setDetectionMethod("berries")}
		>NAME_YOU_WANT_TO_DISPLAY_IN_THE_DROPDOWN</MenuItem>

	** this structure calls the berry detection model by default, which splits 
	   image before passing into model. If you do not want to split...change:
		onClick={() => setDetectionMethod("berries")} to
		onClick={() => setDetectionMethod("bushes")}
  d) save
